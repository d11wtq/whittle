# Whittle: A little LALR(1) Parser in Pure Ruby â€” Not a Generator

Whittle is a LALR(1) parser.  It's very small, easy to understand, and what's most important,
it's 100% ruby.  You write parsers by specifying sequences of allowable rules (which refer to
other rules, or even to themselves).  For each rule in your grammar, you provide a block that
is invoked when the grammar is recognized.

**TL;DR** (Skip to 'Summary & FAQ')

If you're *not* familiar with parsing, you should find Whittle to be a very friendly little
parser.

It is related, somewhat, to yacc and bison, which belong to the class of parsers known as
LALR(1): Left-Right, using 1 Lookahead token.  This class of parsers is both easy to work with
and particularly powerful (ruby itself is parsed using a LALR(1) parser).  Since the algorithm
is based around a theory that *never* has to backtrack (that is, each token read takes the
parse forward, with just a single lookup in a parse table), parse time is also fast.  Parse
time is governed by the size of the input, not by the size of the grammar.

Whittle provides meaningful error reporting (line number, expected tokens, received token) and
even lets you hook into the error handling logic if you need to write some sort of crazy
madman-forgiving parser.

If you've had issues with other parsers hitting "stack level too deep" errors, you should find
that Whittle does not suffer from the same issues, since it uses a state-switching algorithm
(a pushdown automaton to be precise), rather than simply having one parse function call another
and so on.  Whittle also supports the following concepts:

  - Left/right recursion
  - Left/right associativity
  - Operator precedences
  - Skipping of silent tokens in the input (e.g. whitespace/comments)

## Installation

Via rubygems:

    gem install whittle

Or in your Gemfile, if you're using bundler:

    gem 'whittle'

## The Basics

Parsers using Whittle do not generate ruby code from a grammar file.  This may strike users of
other LALR(1) parsers as odd, but c'mon, we're using Ruby, right?

I'll avoid discussing the algorithm until we get into the really advanced stuff, but you will
need to understand a few fundamental ideas before we begin.

  1. There are two types of rule that make up a complete parser: *terminal*, and *nonterminal*
    - A terminal rule is quite simply a chunk of the input string, like '42', or 'function'
    - A nonterminal rule is a rule that makes reference to other rules (both terminal and
      nonterminal)
  2. The input to be parsed *always* conforms to just one rule at the topmost level.  This is
     known as the "start rule" and describes the structure of the program as a whole.

The easiest way to understand how the parser works is just to learn by example, so let's see an
example.

``` ruby
require 'whittle'

class Mathematician < Whittle::Parser
  rule("+")

  rule(:int => /[0-9]+/).as { |num| Integer(num) }

  rule(:expr) do |r|
    r[:int, "+", :int].as { |a, _, b| a + b }
  end

  start(:expr)
end

mathematician = Mathematician.new
mathematician.parse("1+2")
# => 3
```

Let's break this down a bit.  As you can see, the whole thing is really just `rule` used in
different ways.  We also have to set the start rule that we can use to describe an entire
program, which in this case is the `:expr` rule that can add two numbers together.

There are two terminal rules (`"+"` and `:int`) and one nonterminal (`:expr`) in the above
grammar.  Each rule can have a block attached to it.  The block is invoked with the result
evaluating each of its inputs via their own blocks (in a depth-first manner).  The default
action if no block is given, is to return whatever the leftmost input to the rule happens to
be.  We use `#as` to provide an action that actually does something meaningful with the
inputs.

We can optionally use the Hash notation to map a name with a pattern (or a fixed string) when
we declare terminal rules too, as we have done with the `:int` rule above.

As the input string is parsed, it *must* match the start rule `:expr`.

Let's step through the parse for the above input "1+2".

  - When the parser starts, it looks at the start rule `:expr` and decides what tokens would
    be valid if they were encountered.
  - Since `:expr` starts with `:int`, the only thing that would be valid is anything matching
    `/[0-9]+/`.
  - When the parser reads the "1", it recognizes it as an `:int`, evaluates its block (thus
    casting it to an Integer), and moves it aside (puts it on the stack, to be precise).
  - Now it advances through the rule for `:expr` and decides the only valid input would be a
    "+"
  - Upon reading the "+", the rule for "+" is invoked (which does nothing) and the "+" is put
    on the stack, along with the `:int` we already have.
  - Now the parser's only valid input is another `:int`, which it gets from the "2", casting
    it to an Integer according to its block, and putting it on the stack.
  - Finally, upon having read the sequence `:int`, "+", `:int`, our block attached to that
    particular rule is invoked to return a result by summing the 1 and the 2 to make 3. Magic!

This was a simple parse. At each point there was only one valid input.  As we'll see, parses
can be arbitrarily complex, without increasing the amount of work needed to process the input
string.

## Nonterminal rules can have more than one valid sequence

Our mathematician class above is not much of a mathematician.  It can only add numbers together.
Surely subtraction, division and multiplication should be possible too?

It turns out that this is really simple to do.  Just add multiple possibilities to the same
rule.

``` ruby
require 'whittle'

class Mathematician < Whittle::Parser
  rule("+")
  rule("-")
  rule("*")
  rule("/")

  rule(:int => /[0-9]+/).as { |num| Integer(num) }

  rule(:expr) do |r|
    r[:int, "+", :int].as { |a, _, b| a + b }
    r[:int, "-", :int].as { |a, _, b| a - b }
    r[:int, "*", :int].as { |a, _, b| a * b }
    r[:int, "/", :int].as { |a, _, b| a / b }
  end

  start(:expr)
end

mathematician = Mathematician.new

mathematician.parse("1+2")
# => 3

mathematician.parse("1-2")
# => -1

mathematician.parse("2*3")
# => 6

mathematician.parse("4/2")
# => 2
```

Now you're probably beginning to see how matching just one rule for the entire input is not a
problem.  To think about a more real world example, you can describe most programming
languages as a series of statements and constructs.

## Rules can refer to themselves

But our mathematician is still not very bright.  It can only work with two operands.  What about
more complex expressions?

``` ruby
require 'whittle'

class Mathematician < Whittle::Parser
  rule("+")
  rule("-")
  rule("*")
  rule("/")

  rule(:int => /[0-9]+/).as { |num| Integer(num) }

  rule(:expr) do |r|
    r[:expr, "+", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a + b }
    r[:expr, "-", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a - b }
    r[:expr, "*", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a * b }
    r[:expr, "/", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a / b }
    r[:int]
  end

  start(:expr)
end

mathematician = Mathematician.new
mathematician.parse("1+5-2")
# => 4
```

Adding a rule of just `:int` to the `:expr` rule means that any integer is also a valid `:expr`.
It is now possible to say that any `:expr` can be added to, multiplied by, divided by or
subtracted from another `:expr`.  It is this ability to self-reference that makes LALR(1)
parsers so powerful and easy to use.  Note that because the result each input to any given rule
is computed *before* being passed as arguments to the block, each `:expr` in the calculations
above will always be a number, since each `:expr` returns a number.  The recursion in these rules
is practically limitless.  You can write "1+2-3*4+775/3" and it's still an `:expr`.

## Specifying the associativity

If we poke around for more than a few seconds, we'll soon realize that our mathematician  makes
some silly mistakes.  Let's see what happens when we do the following:

``` ruby
mathematician.parse("6-3-1")
# => 4
```

Oops.  That's not correct.  Shouldn't the answer be 2?

Our grammar is ambiguous.  The input string could be interpreted as either:

    6-(3-1)

Or as:

    (6-3)-1

Basic arithmetic takes the latter approach, but the parser's default approach is to go the other
way.  We refer to these two alternatives as being left associative (the second example) and
right associative (the first example).  By default, operators are right associative, which means
as much input will be read as possible before beginning to compute a result.

We can correct this by tagging our operators as left associative.

``` ruby
require 'whittle'

class Mathematician < Whittle::Parser
  rule("+") % :left
  rule("-") % :left
  rule("*") % :left
  rule("/") % :left

  rule(:int => /[0-9]+/).as { |num| Integer(num) }

  rule(:expr) do |r|
    r[:expr, "+", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a + b }
    r[:expr, "-", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a - b }
    r[:expr, "*", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a * b }
    r[:expr, "/", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a / b }
    r[:int]
  end

  start(:expr)
end

mathematician = Mathematician.new
mathematician.parse("6-3-1")
# => 2
```

Attaching a percent sign followed by either `:left` or `:right` changes the associativity of a
terminal rule.  We now get the correct result.

## Specifying the operator precedence

Basic arithmetic is easy peasy, right?  Well, despite fixing the associativity, we find we still
have a problem:

``` ruby
mathematician.parse("1+2*3")
# => 9
```

Hmm.  The expression has been interpreted as (1+2)*3.  It turns out arithmetic is not as simple
as one might think ;)  The parser does not (yet) know that the multiplication operator has a
higher precedence than the addition operator.  We need to indicate this in the grammar.

``` ruby
require 'whittle'

class Mathematician < Whittle::Parser
  rule("+") % :left ^ 1
  rule("-") % :left ^ 1
  rule("*") % :left ^ 2
  rule("/") % :left ^ 2

  rule(:int => /[0-9]+/).as { |num| Integer(num) }

  rule(:expr) do |r|
    r[:expr, "+", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a + b }
    r[:expr, "-", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a - b }
    r[:expr, "*", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a * b }
    r[:expr, "/", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a / b }
    r[:int]
  end

  start(:expr)
end

mathematician = Mathematician.new
mathematician.parse("1+2*3")
# => 7
```

That's better.  We can attach a precedence level to a rule by following it with the caret `^`,
followed by an integer value.  The higher the value, the higher the precedence.  Note that "+"
and "-" both have the same precedence, since "1+(2-3)" and "(1+2)-3" are logically equivalent.
The same applies to "*" and "/", but these both usually have a higher precedence than "+" and
"-".

## Disambiguating expressions with the use of parentheses

Sometimes we really do want "1+2*3" to mean "(1+2)*3", so we should really support this in our
mathematician class.  Fortunately adjusting the syntax rules in Whittle is a painless exercise.

``` ruby
require 'whittle'

class Mathematician < Whittle::Parser
  rule("+") % :left ^ 1
  rule("-") % :left ^ 1
  rule("*") % :left ^ 2
  rule("/") % :left ^ 2

  rule("(")
  rule(")")

  rule(:int => /[0-9]+/).as { |num| Integer(num) }

  rule(:expr) do |r|
    r["(", :expr, ")"].as   { |_, exp, _| exp }
    r[:expr, "+", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a + b }
    r[:expr, "-", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a - b }
    r[:expr, "*", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a * b }
    r[:expr, "/", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a / b }
    r[:int]
  end

  start(:expr)
end

mathematician = Mathematician.new
mathematician.parse("(1+2)*3")
# => 9
```

All we had to do was add the new terminal rules for "(" and ")" then specify that the value of
an expression enclosed in parentheses is simply the value of the expression itself.  We could
just as easily pick some other characters to surround the grouping (maybe "~1+2~*3"), but then
people would think we were silly (arguably, we would be a bit silly if we gave the expression a
curly moustache like that!).

## Skipping whitespace

Most languages contain tokens that are ignored when interpreting the input, such as whitespace
and comments.  Accounting for the possibility of these in all rules would be both wasteful and
tiresome.  Instead, we skip them entirely, by declaring a terminal rule with `#skip!`.

``` ruby
require 'whittle'

class Mathematician < Whittle::Parser
  rule(:wsp => /\s+/).skip!

  rule("+") % :left ^ 1
  rule("-") % :left ^ 1
  rule("*") % :left ^ 2
  rule("/") % :left ^ 2

  rule("(")
  rule(")")

  rule(:int => /[0-9]+/).as { |num| Integer(num) }

  rule(:expr) do |r|
    r["(", :expr, ")"].as   { |_, exp, _| exp }
    r[:expr, "+", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a + b }
    r[:expr, "-", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a - b }
    r[:expr, "*", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a * b }
    r[:expr, "/", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a / b }
    r[:int]
  end

  start(:expr)
end

mathematician = Mathematician.new
mathematician.parse("( 1 + 2)*3 - 4")
# => 5
```

Now the whitespace can either exist between the tokens in the input or not.  The parser doesn't
pay attention to it, it simply discards it as the input string is read.

## Rules can be empty

Sometimes you want to describe a structure, such as a list, that may have zero or more items in
it. In order to do this, the empty rule comes in extremely useful.  Imagine the input string:

    (((())))

We can say that this is matched by any pair of parentheses inside any pair of parentheses, any
number of times. But what's in the middle?

``` ruby
require 'whittle'

class Parser < Whittle::Parser
  rule("(")
  rule(")")

  rule(:parens) do |r|
    r[]
    r["(", :parens, ")"]
  end

  start(:parens)
end
```

The above parser will happily match our input, because it is possible for the `:parens` rule to
match nothing at all, which is what we hit in the middle of our nested parentheses.

This is most useful in constructs like the following:

``` ruby
rule(:id => /[a-z]+/)

rule(:list) do |r|
  r[].as                { [] }
  r[:list, ",", :id].as { |list, _, id| list << id }
  r[:id].as             { |id| [id] }
end
```

The following would return the array `["a", "b", "c"]` given the input string "a, b, c", or
given the input string "" (nothing) it would return the empty array.

## You can use a different start rule on-demand

While this is not advised in production (requiring such a thing in production would suggest
you need to re-think your grammar), during development you may wish to specify any of your
smaller rules as the start rule for a parse.  This is particularly useful in debugging, and
in writing unit tests.

``` ruby
parser.parse(input_string, :rule => :something_else)
```

## Parse errors

### The default error reporting

When the parser encounters an unexpected token in the input, an exception of type
`Whittle::ParseError` is raised.  The exception has a very clear message, indicates the line on
which the error was encountered, and additionally gives you programmatic access to the same
information.

``` ruby
class ListParser < Whittle::Parser
  rule(:wsp => /\s+/).skip!

  rule(:id => /[a-z]+/)

  rule(",")
  rule("-")

  rule(:list) do |r|
    r[:list, ",", :id].as { |list, _, id| list << id }
    r[:id].as             { |id| Array(id) }
  end

  start(:list)
end

str = <<-END
one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen - sixteen, seventeen
END

ListParser.new.parse(str)

# =>
# Parse error: expected "," but got "-" on line 4. (Whittle::ParseError)
#
# Exact region marked...
#
# fourteen, fifteen - sixteen, seventeen
#               ... ^ ... right here
#
```

You can also access `#line`, `#expected` and `#received` if you catch the exception.

### Recovering from a parse error

It is possible to override the `#error` method in the parser to do something smart if you
believe there to be easily resolved parse errors (such as switching the input token to
something else, or rewinding the parse stack to a point where the error would not manifest.  I
need to write some specs on this and explore it fully myself before I document it.  99% of users
would never need to do such a thing.

## More examples

There are some runnable examples included in the examples/ directory.  Playing around with these
would probably be a useful exercise.

If you have any examples you'd like to contribute, I will gladly add them to the repository.

## Summary & FAQ

### Defining a rule to match a chunk of the input string

These are called "terminal rules", since they don't lead anywhere beyond themselves.  A word of
caution here: the ordering matters. They are scanned in order from top to bottom.

``` ruby
rule("keyword")
# or
rule(:name => /pattern/)
```

### Matching with case-insenstivity

You can use the Hash notation from above, with a String as the key, mapping to a Regexp.

``` ruby
rule("function" => /function/i)
```

Now in all rules that allow case-insensitive "function", just use the String `"function"`.

### Providing a semantic action for a terminal rule

``` ruby
rule(:int => /[0-9]+/).as { |str| Integer(str) }
```

### Defining a rule to match a sequence of other rules

These are called "nonterminal rules", since they require chaining to other rules.

``` ruby
rule(:sum) do |r|
  r[:int, "+", :int].as { |a, _, b| a + b }
end
```

Where `:int` and `"+"` have been previously declared by other rules. Arguments `a` and `b` in the
block are the two integers.  Argument `_` is the "+" (which we're not using, hence the argument
name).

### Defining alternatives for the same rule

Call `[](*args)` more than once.

``` ruby
rule(:expr) do |r|
  r[:expr, "+", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a + b }
  r[:expr, "-", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a - b }
  r[:int]
end
```

### Skipping whitespace and comments

``` ruby
rule(:wsp     => /\s+/).skip!
rule(:comment => /#.*$/m).skip!
```

### Looking for the same thing multiple times

Define the rule for the single item, then add another rule for itself, followed by the single item.

``` ruby
rule(:list) do |r|
  r[:list, :id].as { |list, id| list << id }
  r[:id].as        { |id| [id] }
end
```

If you want to allow zero of something, add an additional `r[]`.

### Looking for a comma separated list of something

Just like for above, but with a comma in our recursive rule.

``` ruby
rule(:list) do |r|
  r[:list, ",", :id].as { |list, _, id| list << id }
  r[:id].as        { |id| [id] }
end
```

### Evaluate the left hand side of binary expressions as early as possible

This is called left association. Tag the operators with `% :left`.  They are tagged `% :right` by default.

``` ruby
rule("+") % :left
```

### Give one operator a higher precedence than another

Attach a precedence number to any operators that need them. The higher the number, the higher the precedence.

``` ruby
rule("+") ^ 1
rule("*") ^ 2
```

### How do I make two expresions mutually reference each other?

Let's say you have two types of expression, `:binary_expr` (like "a + b") and `:invocation_expr` (like "foo(bar)").

What you're saying is that any argument in the invocation expression should support either another invocation, or
a `:binary_expr`.  Likewise, you want any operand of `:binary_expr` to support either another `:binary_expr` or
an `:invocation_expr`.

If you can explain it this simply on paper, you can explain it formally in your grammar.  If `:binary_expr`
allows `:invocation_expr` as an operand, and if `:invocation_expr` allows `:binary_expr` as an argument, then
what you're saying is they can be used in place of each other; thus, define a rule that represents the two of them
and use that new rule where you want to support both types of expression.

Assuming your grammar looked something like this pseudo example.

``` ruby
rule("+")

rule(:int => /[0-9]+/).as { |i| Integer(i) }
rule(:id  => /\w+/)

rule(:binary_expr) do |r|
  r[:binary_expr, "+", :binary_expr].as { |a, _, b| a + b}
  r[:int]
end

rule(:args) do |r|
  r[].as            { [] } # empty list
  r[:args, :int].as { |args, i| args << i }
  r[:int].as        { |i| [i] }
end

rule(:invocation_expr) do |r|
  r[:id, "(", :args, ")"].as { |name, _, args, _| FuncCall.new(name, args) }
end
```

This grammar can parse things like "1 + 2 + 3" and "foo(1, 2, 3)", but it can't parse something like
"1 + foo(2 + 3) + 4".

The goal is to replace `:int` in the `:args` rule and `:binary_expr` in the `:binary_expr` rule, with
something that represents both types of expression.

``` ruby
rule("+")

rule(:int => /[0-9]+/).as { |i| Integer(i) }
rule(:id  => /\w+/)

rule(:expr) do |r|
  r[:binary_expr]
  r[:invocation_expr]
end

rule(:binary_expr) do |r|
  r[:expr, "+", :expr].as { |a, _, b| a + b}
  r[:int]
end

rule(:args) do |r|
  r[].as             { [] } # empty list
  r[:args, :expr].as { |args, expr| args << expr }
  r[:expr].as        { |expr| [expr] }
end

rule(:invocation_expr) do |r|
  r[:id, "(", :args, ")"].as { |name, _, args, _| FuncCall.new(name, args) }
end
```

Now we can parse the more complex expression "1 + foo(2, 3) + 4" without any issues.

### How do I track state to store variables etc with Whittle?

In general you build an complete AST to be interpreted if you're writing a program, rather than interpret the input as
it is parsed (what would happen if something had written to disk and then a parse error occurred?).  That said, in
simple cases it may be useful to simply interpret the input as it is read.

One of the goals of making Whittle all ruby was that I wouldn't have to tie people into any particular way of doing
something.  Your blocks can call any ruby code they like, so create an object of some sort those blocks can reference
and do as you need during the parse.  For example, you could add a method to the class called something like `runtime`,
which is accessible from each block.

### I just want Whittle to give me an AST of my input

AST (abstract syntax tree) is a loose term.  Early versions originally created an AST, but the format you want the AST
in probably differs from the format the next developer wants it in.  It's really easy to use your grammar to make one
however you please:

``` ruby
class Parser < Whittle::Parser
  rule("+")

  rule(:int => /[0-9]+/).as { |int| { :int => int } }

  rule(:sum) do |r|
    r[:int, "+", :int].as { |a, _, b| { :sum => [a, b] } }
  end

  start(:sum)
end

p Parser.new.parse("1+2")
# =>
# {:sum=>[{:int=>"1"}, {:int=>"2"}]}
```

(There could be a side-project in this if somebody thinks a "generic AST" is useful enough).

## Issues & Questions

Any issues, I will address them quickly as it is still early days, though I am pretty confident,
since this is based on a scientific algorithm, issues would be relatively minor.  Post them to
the issue tracker:

  - https://github.com/d11wtq/whittle/issues

If you have any suggestions for how I might improve the DSL in order to be more human-friendly,
you can suggest those in the issue tracker too.

For any "how do I do this?" type questions, you can message me directly (via my github profile
page):

  - https://github.com/d11wtq

Or simply post an issue.

## TODO

  - Provide a more powerful (state based) lexer algorithm, or at least document how users can
    override `#lex`.
  - Allow inspection of the parse table (it is not very human friendly right now).
  - Given in an input String, provide a human readble explanation of the parse.
